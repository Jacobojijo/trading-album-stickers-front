# Design System

This folder contain the design system of the project. Including the color palette, typography, and other design elements.

## Color Palette

The color palette is defined in the `colors.js` file. It is a simple object with the color name as the key and the color value as the value. It was inspired by the [FIFA 2022 Logo](https://static1-es.millenium.gg/articles/2/39/04/2/@/200462-fifa-22-article_image_d-2.JPG).
